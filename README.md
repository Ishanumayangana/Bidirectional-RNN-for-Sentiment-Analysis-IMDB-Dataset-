# üìñ Bidirectional RNN for Sentiment Analysis (IMDB Dataset)

This project implements a **Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-RNN)** using **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify movie reviews from the [IMDB dataset](https://keras.io/api/datasets/imdb/).  
The model captures both **forward** and **backward context** in sequences, making it more effective for natural language processing tasks like sentiment classification.

## üöÄ Features
- Loads and preprocesses the **IMDB movie review dataset**  
- Implements a **Bidirectional LSTM** architecture with embeddings  
- Tracks **training & validation curves** (loss, accuracy)  
- Includes **evaluation plots**:
  - Confusion Matrix (heatmap)
  - ROC Curve + AUC
  - Precision‚ÄìRecall Curve
  - Probability Distribution of predictions
- Visualizes the **sequence relationship in a Bi-RNN**  
- Supports saving the trained model to **Google Drive**
